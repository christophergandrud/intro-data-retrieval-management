# Table in a PDF

&lt;img src="img/peace-table.png" width="400px" height="300px" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

PDF at: &lt;https://www.visionofhumanity.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GPI_2020_web.pdf&gt;

Example modified from [Ketan Deshpande](https://medium.com/@ketanrd.009/how-to-extract-pdf-tables-in-r-e994c0fe4e28) and then updated to use Python.

# parse PDF 

There used to an R package called [tabulizer](https://github.com/ropensci/tabulizer) package to parse PDFs in R. But it is not currently downloadable on CRAN.

There are at least two alternatives:

- (the one I don't recommend) [pdftools](https://docs.ropensci.org/pdftools/) package to parse PDFs in R. This does not require rJava, but its `pdf_data()` function is less powerful for extracting tables from PDFs.

- tabula-py: a Python version of tabulizer. It's more powerful than pdftools, but harder to set up. It requires setting up Java, Python, and calling the two from R. See set up instructions [here](https://github.com/christophergandrud/hu-live-coding-course-examples/blob/main/src/set-up-tabula-python.md).

# Download PDF and extract table


```r
xfun::pkg_attach2("tidyverse", "reticulate")

# Find the the location of Python on your computer with `which python3` in the Terminal
use_python("/opt/homebrew/bin/python3")

# Load tabula package as tb
tabula &lt;- import("tabula")

table_list &lt;- tabula$read_pdf("https://www.visionofhumanity.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GPI_2020_web.pdf", 
                        user_agent="Mozilla/5.0", pages="10")

df &lt;- table_list[[1]] # Extract data table from list
head(df)
```

[GitHub](https://github.com/christophergandrud/hu-live-coding-course-examples/blob/main/src/tabula-reticulate-example.R)

The data frame still needs cleaning using the tools we covered in previous sessions.

Note: you can also extract text data from PDFs using tabula.

# 📑 Text as data

So far we have assumed that we want to get data into tidy data format, probably for a standard statistical analysis (e.g. linear regression). 

But, we may want to conduct an analysis of the text itself, e.g. [Grimmer and Stewart (2013)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/political-analysis/article/text-as-data-the-promise-and-pitfalls-of-automatic-content-analysis-methods-for-political-texts/F7AAC8B2909441603FEB25C156448F20), using **natural language processing** (NPL) methods. 

Key tools include the [quanteda](https://github.com/quanteda/quanteda) and [tm](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tm/tm.pdf) (text mining) packages.

# Example

Let's scrape COVID-19 press releases from the British Government.

Navigate to &lt;https://www.gov.uk/search/news-and-communications&gt;.

&lt;img src="img/uk-gov-announcements.png" width="400px" height="400px" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

# Checkout URL structure

Imagine we want to study the Prime Minister's communications regarding COVID-19. 

Understand the URL structure:

&lt;img src="img/boris-news.png" width="200px" height="200px" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

&lt;https://www.gov.uk/search/news-and-communications?level_one_taxon=5b7b9532-a775-4bd2-a3aa-6ce380184b6c&amp;people%5B%5D=boris-johnson&amp;order=updated-newest&gt;

---

# Checkout URL structure for announcements


&lt;img src="img/list-item.png" width="2752" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

Links to each announcement are stored in the `href` of anchor tags (`&lt;a&gt;`).

---

# Download the search page


```r
library(rvest)

url &lt;- "https://www.gov.uk/search/news-and-communications?level_one_taxon=5b7b9532-a775-4bd2-a3aa-6ce380184b6c&amp;people%5B%5D=boris-johnson&amp;order=updated-newest"

announce_page &lt;- read_html(url)

announce_page
```

```
## {html_document}
## &lt;html class="govuk-template" lang="en"&gt;
## [1] &lt;head&gt;\n&lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8 ...
## [2] &lt;body class="gem-c-layout-for-public govuk-template__body "&gt;\n    &lt;script ...
```

# Extract the partial URLS with xpath

**xpath** (XML Path Language) allows you to query nodes in an html document.

&lt;img src="img/xpath-copy.gif" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

# Extract the partial URLs with xpath


```r
announce_page_href_1 &lt;- html_elements(announce_page,
                        xpath = '//*[@id="js-results"]/div/ul/li[1]/a') %&gt;%
                        html_attr('href') # we want the href element
announce_page_href_1
```

```
## [1] "/government/news/prime-minister-announces-covid-19-inquiry-chair"
```

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

This only extracted the first href because we explicitly referenced the first list item (`li[1]`)
---

# 🔥 Wild cards

Use the `*` wild card to match all of the list items. 


```r
announce_page_href &lt;- html_elements(announce_page,
                                 xpath = '//*[@id="js-results"]/div/ul/li[*]/a') %&gt;%
  html_attr('href') # we want the href element
announce_page_href
```

## [1] "\n        \n    \n          \n\nUpdate: 28 February 2022\n\nThe Inquiry now has its own independent website.\n\nVisit the UK COVID-19 Inquiry website for the latest news and updates.\n\n\nToday (Wednesday 15 December) the Prime Minister has appointed the Rt Hon Baroness Heather Hallett DBE as Chair of the forthcoming public inquiry into the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe Inquiry, set to begin its work in spring 2022, will be established under the Inquiries Act 2005, with full powers, including the power to compel the production of documents and to summon witnesses to give evidence on oath. Additional panel members will be appointed in the new year to make sure the Inquiry has access to the full range of expertise needed to complete its important work.\n\nThe Inquiry will play a key role in examining the UK’s pandemic response and ensuring that we learn the right lessons for the future. The Prime Minister will now consult Baroness Hallett and ministers from the devolved administrations on the terms of reference for the Inquiry and will publish them in draft in the new year.\n\nThose most affected by the pandemic - including those who have sadly lost loved ones - must also have an opportunity to play their proper role in the process. Once the terms of reference have been published in draft, Baroness Hallett will take forward a process of public engagement and consultation - including with bereaved families and other affected groups - before the terms of reference are finalised.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said:\n\n\n  I want to thank Baroness Hallett for agreeing to take on the position of Chair of the COVID-19 Inquiry.\n\n\n\n  She brings a wealth of experience to the role and I know shares my determination that the inquiry examines in a forensic and thoroughgoing way the government’s response to the pandemic.\n\n\nThe Rt Hon Baroness Heather Hallett DBE, said:\n\n\n  I am honoured to be appointed to chair the COVID-19 Inquiry. The pandemic has affected us all, some much worse than others. I am acutely conscious of the suffering it has caused to so many.\n\n\n\n  In the new year I shall be seeking views from those who have lost loved ones and all other affected groups about the Inquiry’s terms of reference.\n\n\n\n  I want to assure the British public that, once the terms of reference are finalised, I shall do my utmost to ensure the Inquiry answers as many questions as possible about the UK’s response to the pandemic so that we can all learn lessons for the future.\n\n\nBaroness Hallett retired from the Court of Appeal in 2019 and was made a crossbench life peer. She has previously conducted a range of high-profile and complex inquests, inquiries and reviews, including acting as coroner for the inquests into the deaths of the 52 victims of the 7 July 2005 London bombings; as chair of the Iraq Fatalities Investigations; and as chair of the 2014 Hallett Review of the administrative scheme to deal with ‘on the runs’ in Northern Ireland.\n\nBaroness Hallett is currently acting as coroner in the inquest into the death of Dawn Sturgess, who died in July 2018 following exposure to the nerve agent Novichok. A new chair for that inquiry will be appointed early in the new year.\n\n\n\n      "
