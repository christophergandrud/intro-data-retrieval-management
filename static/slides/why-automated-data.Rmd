# ü§î In your research:

- do you plan to **repeat** the task?

- do you want others to be able to **replicate** your data collection process?

- do you use **online** data sources?

- does the data task have **non-trivial** scope and complexity?

# üéì Academic

- Skills needed to do **original quantitative research** for your **research**.

- State-of-the-art tools needed for **future high-level academic research**.

    + Take advantage of new data sources

    + Avoid effort duplication

    + Make your research reproducible

---

# üèõ Government 

- Public data is increasingly **accessible**.

    + e.g. [World Bank Development Indicators](http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development-indicators),
    [GovData Germany](https://www.govdata.de/neues), [Berlin Open Data](https://daten.berlin.de/), [data.gov.uk](http://data.gov.uk/),
    [New York City](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/),
    [data.gov](https://www.data.gov/open-gov/)

- Governments rely on data analysis for evidence based decision-making.

    + Tools of open data analysis enable better use of data **within** and
    **between** government actors.

    + Governments can take advantage of analyses done by **third parties**.

---

# üèï NGOs

NGO's are becoming increasingly data-oriented and need people with **skills** to
**handle and analyse** this data.

Ex. Former Hertie Master's students co-founded
[CorrelAid](http://correlaid.org/) to assist NGOs with data analysis.

# What is open public data?

---

# What is open public data?

Janssen (2012, 258):

> "Non-privacy-restricted and non-confidential data which is produced with public money and is made available without any restrictions on its usage or distribution."

---

# Some benefits of open public data

- **Greater returns** on public investment in data gathering.

- Better **coordination** within government.

- Provides **policy-makers with information** needed to address complex problems.

- "**Mends the traditional separation** between public organizations and users".

See Janssen (2012, 261) for more.

---

# Mending separation between public and users

- **Assumes** that government **considers outside** views and information (including opposing) views as **constructive**.

  + Not always a correct assumption. E.g. there are reasons why it is basically impossible to get US-wide data on deaths by police.

- Results in government **giving up** (some) control and more **actively interacting** with its environment.

---

# An ideal for open public data


> Not only should data be published, but potential **data users in society** should be
**actively** sought for input on **improving government**.

---

# Challenges to open data

- **Lack of technological competence** to implement open data that is **useful**.

- **Worry** by bureaucrats that open data will be used to **criticise** them.

- **No incentives** for users to access the data. **Lack of skills** needed
to use and understand the data.

- Balancing individual **privacy** concerns.

See Janssen (2012, 262-263) for more.

# üè≠ Industry 

Automated data collection and retrieval **scales**.

We don't just want to solve a customer problem once, we want to solve it many times with the **marginal cost decreasing** each additional time we solve the problem.

```{r return-to-scale, echo=FALSE, fig.height = 2.5, dpi=300}
x <- seq(1, 10, 0.01)
returns_to_scale <- tibble(x = x, y = x^-2)

ggplot(returns_to_scale, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_line(color = "pink", linewidth = 1) +
  xlab("Quantity produced") + ylab("Cost of production\n") +
  theme(
        axis.text.x=element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.x=element_blank(),
        axis.text.y=element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.y=element_blank()
        )
```

‚ö†Ô∏è While automated data retrieval and management is more important than ever
within companies, it's the openness of companies to each other and researchers,
e.g. via APIs, is perhaps declining as companies develop **walled data gardens**.

#  Really reproducible research

> the data and code used to make a finding are **available** and they are **sufficient** for an independent researcher to **recreate the finding** (Peng 2011, 1226)

Make available the research, **not just the advertising** for the findings (e.g. papers, book).

---

# Reproducibility vs. Replication

**Reproducibility**: an independent study makes the same findings using the
**same data** and **code** as the original researchers.

**Replicability**: an independent study makes the same conclusions as the original
using **other** data, code, and even methods,
i.e. independent verification.

---

# Reproducibility vs. Replication

> ''A study can be reproducible and still be wrong'' [Peng 2014](http://simplystatistics.org/2014/06/06/the-real-reason-reproducible-research-is-important/).

E.g. a finding that is statistically significant in one study may remain statistically
significant when reproduced using the original data/code, but **replication studies
are unable to find a similar result**.

The original finding could just have been
[noise](http://andrewgelman.com/2014/09/03/disagree-alan-turing-daniel-kahneman-regarding-strength-statistical-evidence/).

---

# Why reproducibility?

- **Replication** is the ''**ultimate standard**'' for judging scientific claims (Peng 2011).

- **Reproducibility**

    + **Enhances replication** (other researchers can understand how an analysis
    was actually done)

    + Is a **minimum standard** for judging scientific claims when replication is
    not possible.

---

# Why reproducibility?

Reproducibility helps **avoid effort duplication**:

- Others **don't waste time**:

    + Gathering data that has already been gathered.

    + Discovering procedures that have already been discovered.

---

# Why reproducibility?

- Reproducibility also makes it possible to **find and correct errors**.

- Recent examples:
    - Translation errors in the
    [World Values Survey](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2014/09/02/world-values-lost-in-translation/).

    - Data errors in research on
    [intestinal worm treatment and school attendance](http://www.columbia.edu/~mh2245/w/worms.html).

    - [L'Affaire LaCour](http://www.vox.com/2015/5/20/8630535/same-sex-marriage-study):
    data *fabrication* discovered.

- Data errors can cause spurious findings that ultimately **waste researchers time**,
because they try to explain 'wrong' findings.

---

# Why reproducibility?

- **Higher research impact**

    + Reproducible research is likely to be more **useful for other researchers**.
    They can use your data and learn from your code and methods.

    + More use ‚Üí more impact (e.g. citations)

- **Better work habits**

    + Thinking about reproducibility from the beginning makes your files
    **better organised** and your work is **better documented**.

    + This allows you to **build on your own work** more effectively.

class: inverse, center, middle
background-color: #000000

# üèõ Ethical data retrieval and management

> Privacy and data protection are fundamental rights, which need to be protected. ([EUI 2022](https://www.eui.eu/Documents/ServicesAdmin/DeanOfStudies/ResearchEthics/Guide-Data-Protection-Research.pdf))

---

# Always. . .

Consider the needs for privacy and protecting persons' data.

‚ö†Ô∏è It is especially important for automated data retrieval and management to **build in** privacy and data protection. 

‚ö†Ô∏è Automated data retrieval and management scale. If done poorly, can **scale privacy infringements**. 

---

# Personal data 

> In legal terms, ‚Äòpersonal data‚Äô means: any information relating to identified or identifiable natural persons referred to as 'data subjects. 'Identifiable persons' can be identified:
- directly, or
- indirectly, in particular by reference to an identification number or to one or more factors specific to their physical, psychological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity.

.small[EUI (2019, 5)]

---

# Really hard to anonymize

You might think you can simply replace peoples' names with a random number, but . . .

> I conducted an example re-identification study by showing how newspaper stories about hospital visits in Washington State leads to identifying the matching health record 43% of the time ([Sweeney 2015](https://techscience.org/a/2015092903/))

Sweeney's insights led to new areas of data management like [differential privacy](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2018/11/06/what-is-differential-privacy/). 

---

# Data privacy

> can mean different things in different contexts and cultures. It is therefore important
to detail the purpose of the research according to the different understandings of privacy. For
example, in ‚Äòcovert research‚Äô researchers should take into account the meanings of public and
private in the contexts they are studying. Covert observation should only proceed if researchers
can demonstrate clear benefits of the research, when no other research approach seems possible
and when it is reasonably certain that no one will be harmed or suffer as a result of the
observation. EUI (2019, 5)

---

# Data protection

> aims at guaranteeing the individual‚Äôs right to privacy. It refers to the **technical
and legal framework** designed to **ensure that personal data are safe** from unforeseen, unintended
or malevolent use. Data protection therefore includes e.g. measures concerning collection, access
to data, communication and conservation of data. In addition, a data protection strategy can also
include measures to assure the accuracy of the data. EUI (2019, 5)

---

# üá™üá∫ GDPR

The EU is a leader in data protection with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR, 2016).

---

# üá™üá∫ GDPR penalties

> a fine up to **‚Ç¨20 million or up to 4% of the annual worldwide turnover** of the preceding financial year in case of an enterprise, whichever is greater, if there has been an infringement of the following provisions: (Article 83, Paragraph 5 & 6[31])
- the basic principles for processing, including conditions for consent, pursuant to Articles 5, 6, 7, and 9
the data subjects' rights pursuant to Articles 12 to 222
- the transfers of personal data to a recipient in a third country or an international organisation pursuant to Articles 44 to 49
- any obligations pursuant to member state law adopted under Chapter IX
- noncompliance with an order or a temporary or definitive limitation on processing or the suspension of data flows by the supervisory authority pursuant to Article 58(2) or failure to provide access in violation of Article 58(1)

---

# (some) Good practices

**üëç Do**

- Follow your institution's **data protection policies**.

- Clearly **document** all of the data you have, your justification for having it, how you maintain and delete it.

- If you handle personal data, **test** that all of your data pipelines don't "leak" the data before you include personal data in it.

- Regularly **review** what data you have and your reason for  having it.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Don't**

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Never store** personally identifiable data in non-secure locations

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Never transport** personally identifiable data in non-secure ways (e.g. email)

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Never store** credentials in non-secure locations (e.g. use a password manager with command line access)

# Assumptions behind xkcd framework

JD Long [highlights](https://twitter.com/CMastication/status/1390752830177398785) key assumptions behind this framework that might not hold:

- All time is the same value -> but time right before a deadline might be more valuable than other time

- Automated work is the same quality as non-automated: the process of automation often improves quality (e.g. increases reproducibility)

- The frequency of doing a process stays the same after it is automated: automation makes it easier to do the process again -> you do it more

---

# ‚ö†Ô∏è The internet is unstable

Never assume that URLs and content at a URL is stable! 

A URL does not have a contract with you to provide stable data. 

You need to be **defensive**, i.e. save/cache copies of the data on your side and include tests in your code to ensure that you quickly identify changes.

---

# More on how to think about trade off decisions

If we have time, we'll look into more details on how to thinking about software design to help you structure your automation/research software. See slides [here](https://github.com/christophergandrud/misc-speaking-notes/blob/main/reproducible-research-as-software-design.pdf).

---

# Large Language Models (LLM) and Automation

Large Language Models, like [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/), have the potential to **dramatically reduce** automation time and effort, making automation a better decision than before.

**Human in the Loop Coding**:

`Describe automation task -> ChatGPT Creates Code -> Run/Debug and Modify Request -> ChatGPT Creates Code -> Run/Debug and Modify (including refactor), etc.`

&#x2753; **Do we need to learn to code anymore?**

-   Yes. LLMs are amazing. But they mess up a lot. 

-   To be effective, you need to **understand** their output and be **able to ask** informative debugging questions. --> This course will give you a foundation to be able to do this effectively.
