<h2>üèÅ Getting Started with R and RStudio</h2>
<p>To complete the exercises in this course, you will need to access
RStudio.</p>
<p>You can do this in the cloud on the course‚Äôs <strong>Posit [RStudio] cloud</strong> site:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://rstudio.cloud/project/1140732" class="uri">https://rstudio.cloud/project/1140732</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Or download and <strong>install</strong> R and RStudio on your computer:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Install R: <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/" class="uri">https://cran.r-project.org/</a></p></li>
<li><p>Install RStudio (free version):
<a href="https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/" class="uri">https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/</a></p></li>
</ol>
<p>Once you open RStudio, take some time to explore the interface. Then
we‚Äôll dive into details.</p>
<p>Notice in particular the <code>&gt;</code> character in the left-most window called
the <strong>Console</strong>. This prompt is where you enter R code. To run R code
that you have typed after the prompt, press the <code>Return</code> or <code>Enter</code> key.</p>
<p>It is also a good idea to become familiar with the command line terminal
outside of R. We will touch on this, especially in Part II of the
course.</p>
<p>üíÅ Tip: in the R Console or the Terminal, you can cancel a process with <code>Ctrl + c</code>. You can clear your Console with <code>Ctrl + l</code>. Note, the content wasn‚Äôt actually deleted, just scroll up to see the previous content.</p>
<div id="optional-rstudio-alternative-jupyter-lab" class="section level3">
<h3>[Optional RStudio Alternative] Jupyter Lab</h3>
<p>Jupyter Lab is a popular alternative to RStudio. It is less tailored to
R, but is used in many especially industry settings. If you would like
to try it out, see setup instructions
<a href="https://github.com/christophergandrud/hu-live-coding-course-examples/blob/main/src/jupyter-lab-setup.md">here</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="markdown" class="section level3">
<h3>Markdown</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet">Markdown</a>
is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language">markup language</a>
widely used in data science to format human readable documents,
especially interspersed with code. It is used in
<a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/">RMarkdown</a> (how these materials are
created), <a href="https://quarto.org/">Quarto (a more expansive RMarkdown)</a>, and Jupyter Lab.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="install-packages" class="section level2">
<h2>Install packages</h2>
<p>In base R, use the <code>install.packages()</code> function to install the add-on
packages you‚Äôll need to gather and manage data:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>When you install a package, you will likely be given a list of ‚Äúmirrors‚Äù
from which you can download the package. Select the mirror closest to
you.</p>
<div id="load-packages" class="section level3">
<h3>Load packages</h3>
<p>To use the packages, you need to theme with the <code>library()</code> function:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(&quot;tidyverse&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Personally, I prefer (and will use for the rest of the course)
<code>xfun::pkg_attach2()</code>. It installs packages if they aren‚Äôt present and
loads them all in one call.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>xfun::pkg_attach2(&quot;tidyverse&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Note you will need to install the <code>xfun</code> package
(<code>install.packages("xfun")</code>) if you haven‚Äôt already.</p>
</div>

<div id="object-oriented-programming-in-the-r-language" class="section level2">
<h2>Object Oriented Programming in the R Language</h2>
<div id="objects" class="section level3">
<h3>Objects: R‚Äôs ‚Äúnouns‚Äù</h3>
<p>If you‚Äôve read a description of the R language before, you will probably
have seen it referred to as an ‚Äòobject-oriented language‚Äô. What are
objects? Objects are like the R language‚Äôs <em>nouns</em>. They are things,
like a vector of numbers, a data set, a word, a table of results from
some analysis, and so on. Saying that R is object-oriented means that R
is focused on doing actions to objects. We will talk about the actions,
functions, later in this section. Now let‚Äôs create a few objects.</p>
<div id="numeric-string-type" class="section level4">
<h4>Numeric and string type objects</h4>
<p>Objects can have a number of different <em>types</em>. Let‚Äôs make two simple
objects. The first is a <strong>numeric</strong>-type object. The other is a
<strong>character</strong> object.</p>
<p>We can choose almost any name we want for our objects as long as it
begins with an alphabetic character and does not contain spaces. Just
because there are relatively few hard restrictions on object names,
doesn‚Äôt mean that you should name your object anything. Your code will
be much easier to read if object names are short and meaningful. Give
each object a unique name to avoid confusion and conflicts. For example,
if you reuse an object name in an R session, you could easily
accidentally overwrite it.</p>
<p>Good object names also help your code be <strong>self documenting</strong>, enhancing review, reproducibility, and reuse.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs begin working with numeric objects by creating a new object called
<em>number</em> with the number 10 in it. Use the <strong>assignment operator</strong>
(<code>&lt;-</code>) to put something into the object:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>number &lt;- 10</code></pre>
<p>To see the contents of our object, type its name into the R console.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>number</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 10</code></pre>
<p>Let‚Äôs briefly breakdown this output. <code>10</code> is clearly the contents of
<em>number</em>. The double hash (<code>##</code>) is included here to tell you that this
is output rather than R code. If you run functions in your R console,
you will not get the double hash in your output. Finally, <code>[1]</code> gives
the position in the object that the number 10 is on. Our object only has
one position.</p>
<p>Creating an object with words and other characters, a character object,
is very similar. The only difference is that you enclose the character
string (letters in a word for example) inside of single or double
quotation marks (<code>''</code>, or <code>""</code>). Let‚Äôs create an object called <em>words</em>
containing the character string <code>Hello World</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Create hello world character string
words &lt;- &quot;Hello World&quot;</code></pre>
<p>An object‚Äôs type is important to keep in mind. It determines what we can
do to the object. For example, you cannot take the mean of a character
object like the <em>words</em> object:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>mean(words)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Warning in mean.default(words): argument is not numeric or logical: returning
## NA</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] NA</code></pre>
<p>Trying to find the mean of our <em>words</em> object gives us a warning message
and returns the value NA: not applicable. You can also
think of <code>NA</code> as meaning ‚Äúmissing‚Äù. To find out an object‚Äôs type, use
the <code>class()</code> function. For example:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>class(words)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;character&quot;</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="vectors-data-frames" class="section level4">
<h4>Vector and data frame type objects</h4>
<p>So far, we have only looked at objects with a single number or character
string. Clearly we often want to use objects that have many strings and
numbers. In R these are usually data frame-type objects and are roughly
equivalent to the data structures you would be familiar with from using
a program such as Microsoft Excel. We will be using data frames
extensively throughout the book. Before looking at data frames it is
useful to first look at the simpler objects that make up data frames.
These are called vectors. Vectors are R‚Äôs ‚Äúworkhorse‚Äù <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-matloff2011">Matloff 2011</a>)</span>.</p>
<div id="vectors" class="section level5">
<h5>Vectors</h5>
<p>Vectors are the ‚Äúfundamental data type‚Äù in R <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-matloff2011">Matloff 2011</a>)</span>. They are an
ordered group of numbers, character strings, and so on. It may be useful
to think of most data in R as composed of vectors. For example, data
frames are basically collections of vectors of the same length, i.e.
they have the same number of rows, attached together to form columns.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs create a simple numeric vector containing the numbers 2.8, 2, and
14.8. To do this, we will use the <code>c()</code> (combine) function and separate
the numbers with commas (<code>,</code>):</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Create numeric vector
numeric_vector &lt;- c(2.8, 2, 14.8)

# Show numeric_vector&#39;s contents
numeric_vector</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1]  2.8  2.0 14.8</code></pre>
<p>Vectors of character strings are created in a similar way. The only
difference is that each character string is enclosed in quotation marks
like this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>character_vector &lt;- c(&quot;Albania&quot;, &quot;Botswana&quot;, &quot;Cambodia&quot;)

# Show character_vector&#39;s contents
character_vector</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;Albania&quot;  &quot;Botswana&quot; &quot;Cambodia&quot;</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="matrices" class="section level5">
<h5>Matrices</h5>
<p>To give you a preview of what we are going to do when we start working
with real data sets, let‚Äôs combine the two vectors <em>numeric_vector</em> and
<em>character_vector</em> into a new object with the <code>cbind()</code> function. This
function binds the two vectors together side-by-side as columns.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>string_num_matrix &lt;- cbind(character_vector, numeric_vector)
string_num_matrix</code></pre>
<pre><code>##      character_vector numeric_vector
## [1,] &quot;Albania&quot;        &quot;2.8&quot;         
## [2,] &quot;Botswana&quot;       &quot;2&quot;           
## [3,] &quot;Cambodia&quot;       &quot;14.8&quot;</code></pre>
<p>By binding these two objects together, we‚Äôve created a new matrix
object. You can see that the numbers in the <strong>numeric_vector</strong> column
are between quotation marks. Matrices, like vectors, can only have one
data type, so R has converted the numbers to strings.</p>
</div>
<div id="data-frames" class="section level5">
<h5>Data frames</h5>
<p>If we want to have an object with rows and columns and allow the columns
to contain data with different types, we need to use data frames. Let‚Äôs
use the <code>data.frame</code> function to combine the <em>numeric_vector</em> and
<em>character_vector</em> objects.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>string_num_df &lt;- data.frame(character_vector, numeric_vector)
string_num_df</code></pre>
<pre><code>##   character_vector numeric_vector
## 1          Albania            2.8
## 2         Botswana            2.0
## 3         Cambodia           14.8</code></pre>
<p>In this output, you can see the data frame‚Äôs <em>names</em> attribute. It is
the column names. You can use the <code>names()</code> function to see any data
frame‚Äôs names:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>names(string_num_df)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;character_vector&quot; &quot;numeric_vector&quot;</code></pre>
<p>You will also notice that the first column of the data set has no name
and is a series of numbers. This is the <em>row.names</em> attribute. Data
frame rows can be given any name as long as each row name is unique. We
can use the <code>row.names()</code> function to set the row names from a vector.
For example,</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Reassign row.names
row.names(string_num_df) &lt;- c(&quot;First&quot;, &quot;Second&quot;, &quot;Third&quot;)

# Display new row.names
row.names(string_num_df)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;First&quot;  &quot;Second&quot; &quot;Third&quot;</code></pre>
<p>You can see in this example how <code>row.names()</code> can also be used to print
the row names. The <em>row.names</em> attribute does not behave like a regular
data frame column. You cannot, for example, include it as a variable in
a regression. You can use the <code>row.names()</code> function to assign the
<em>row.names</em> values to a regular column.</p>
<p>You will notice in the output for <em>string_num_df</em> that the strings in
the <strong>character_vector</strong> column are not in quotation marks. This does
not mean that they are now numeric data. To prove this, try to find the
mean of <strong>character_vector</strong> by running it through the <code>mean()</code>
function:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>mean(string_num_df$character_vector)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Warning in mean.default(string_num_df$character_vector): argument is not
## numeric or logical: returning NA</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] NA</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div id="lists" class="section level4">
<h4>Lists</h4>
<p>Lists are objects whose contents can be items of different values. For
example you could have a list with a vector and a data frame. Use the
<code>list()</code> function to create lists. For example:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>vector_df_list &lt;- list(numeric_vector, string_num_df)

vector_df_list</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [[1]]
## [1]  2.8  2.0 14.8
## 
## [[2]]
##        character_vector numeric_vector
## First           Albania            2.8
## Second         Botswana            2.0
## Third          Cambodia           14.8</code></pre>
<p>Note that each element of the list has a number. For example, the former
contents of <em>numeric_vector</em> are element <code>[[1]]</code>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="component-selection" class="section level3">
<h3>Component selection</h3>
<p>The last bit of code we just saw will probably be confusing. Why do we
have a dollar sign (<code>$</code>) between the name of our data frame object name
and the <code>character_vector</code> variable? The dollar sign is called the
component selector.
It‚Äôs also sometimes called the element name operator. Either way, it
extracts a part, component, of an object. In the previous example, it
extracted the <strong>character_vector</strong> column from the <em>string_num_df</em> so
that it could be fed to the <code>mean()</code> function.</p>
<p>We can use the component selector to create new objects with parts of
other objects. Imagine that we have <em>string_num_df</em> and want an object
with only the information in the <strong>numeric_vector</strong> column. Let‚Äôs use
the following code:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Extract a numeric vector from string_num_df
numeric_extract &lt;- string_num_df$numeric_vector
numeric_extract</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1]  2.8  2.0 14.8</code></pre>
<div id="subscripts" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Subscripts</h4>
<p>Another way to select parts of an object is to use subscripts. You have
already seen subscripts in the output from our examples so far. They are
denoted with square braces (<code>[]</code>). We can use subscripts to select not
only columns from data frames but also rows and individual values. As we
began to see in some of the previous output, each part of a data frame
has an address captured by its row and column number. We can tell R to
find a part of an object by putting the row number/name, column
number/name, or both in square braces. The first part denotes the rows
and separated by a comma (<code>,</code>) are the columns.</p>
<p>To give you an idea of how this works, let‚Äôs use the <em>cars</em> data set
again. Use <code>head()</code> to get a sense of what this data looks like.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>head(cars)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##   speed dist
## 1     4    2
## 2     4   10
## 3     7    4
## 4     7   22
## 5     8   16
## 6     9   10</code></pre>
<p>We can see a data frame with information on various car speeds
(<strong>speed</strong>) and stopping distances (<strong>dist</strong>). If we want to select only
the third through seventh rows, we can use the following subscript
function call:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>cars[3:7, ]</code></pre>
<pre><code>##   speed dist
## 3     7    4
## 4     7   22
## 5     8   16
## 6     9   10
## 7    10   18</code></pre>
<p>The colon (<code>:</code>) creates a sequence of whole numbers from 3 to 7. To
select the fourth row of the <strong>dist</strong> column, we can type:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>cars[4, 2]</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 22</code></pre>
<p>An equivalent way to do this is:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>cars[4, &quot;dist&quot;]</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 22</code></pre>
<p>Finally, we can even include a vector of column names to select:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>cars[4, c(&quot;speed&quot;, &quot;dist&quot;)]</code></pre>
<pre><code>##   speed dist
## 4     7   22</code></pre>
<p>To extract elements of a list use the double square brackets <code>[[]]</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>vector_df_list[[2]]</code></pre>
<pre><code>##        character_vector numeric_vector
## First           Albania            2.8
## Second         Botswana            2.0
## Third          Cambodia           14.8</code></pre>
<p>You can stack up component selectors to extract deeper components of a
list. For example:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>vector_df_list[[2]]$numeric_vector</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1]  2.8  2.0 14.8</code></pre>
