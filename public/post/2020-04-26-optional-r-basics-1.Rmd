## üëã Welcome

Welcome to to the course! This is the first of 2 sets of exercises
introducing you to the R programming language[^1] that we will use
throughout the course.

[^1]: These lessons are based on @gandrud2020, Chapter 3.

This and the next lesson are optional. Their intended for you if you are
not that familiar with R, or you would like to practice your R basics
before getting started.

## üèÅ Getting Started with R and RStudio {#install-rstudio}

To complete the exercises in this course, you will need to access
RStudio.

You can do this in the cloud on the course's **RStudio cloud** site:

-   <https://rstudio.cloud/project/1140732>

Or download and **install** R and RStudio on your computer:

1.  Install R: <https://cran.r-project.org/>

2.  Install RStudio (free version):
    <https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/>

Once you open RStudio, take some time to explore the interface. Then
we'll dive into details.

Notice in particular the `>` character in the left-most window called
the **Console**. This prompt is where you enter R code. To run R code
that you have typed after the prompt, press the `Return` or `Enter` key.

It is also a good idea to become familiar with the command line terminal
outside of R. We will touch on this, especially in Part II of the
course.

üíÅ Tip: in the R Console or the Terminal, you can cancel a process with `Ctrl + c`. You can clear your Console with `Ctrl + l`. Note, the content wasn't actually deleted, just scroll up to see the previous content.

### [Optional RStudio Alternative] Jupyter Lab

Jupyter Lab is a popular alternative to RStudio. It is less tailored to
R, but is used in many especially industry settings. If you would like
to try it out, see setup instructions
[here](https://github.com/christophergandrud/hu-live-coding-course-examples/blob/main/src/jupyter-lab-setup.md).

### Markdown

[Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
is a [markup language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language)
widely used in data science to format human readable documents,
especially interspersed with code. It is used in both
[RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) (how these materials are
created) and Jupyter Lab.

## Install packages {#install-packages}

In base R, use the `install.packages()` function to install the add-on
packages you'll need to gather and manage data:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

When you install a package, you will likely be given a list of "mirrors"
from which you can download the package. Select the mirror closest to
you.

### Load packages

To use the packages, you need to theme with the `library()` function:

```{r eval=FALSE}
library("tidyverse")
```

Personally, I prefer (and will use for the rest of the course)
`xfun::pkg_attach2()`. It installs packages if they aren't present and
loads them all in one call.

```{r eval=FALSE}
xfun::pkg_attach2("tidyverse")
```

Note you will need to install the `xfun` package
(`install.packages("xfun")`) if you haven't already.

## Object Oriented Programming in the R Language

### Objects: R's "nouns" {#objects}

If you've read a description of the R language before, you will probably
have seen it referred to as an 'object-oriented language'. What are
objects? Objects are like the R language's *nouns*. They are things,
like a vector of numbers, a data set, a word, a table of results from
some analysis, and so on. Saying that R is object-oriented means that R
is focused on doing actions to objects. We will talk about the actions,
functions, later in this section. Now let's create a few objects.

#### Numeric and string type objects {#numeric-string-type}

Objects can have a number of different *types*. Let's make two simple
objects. The first is a **numeric**-type object. The other is a
**character** object.

We can choose almost any name we want for our objects as long as it
begins with an alphabetic character and does not contain spaces. Just
because there are relatively few hard restrictions on object names,
doesn't mean that you should name your object anything. Your code will
be much easier to read if object names are short and meaningful. Give
each object a unique name to avoid confusion and conflicts. For example,
if you reuse an object name in an R session, you could easily
accidentally overwrite it.

Good object names also help your code be **self documenting**, enhancing review, reproducibility, and reuse.

Let's begin working with numeric objects by creating a new object called
*number* with the number 10 in it. Use the **assignment operator**
(`<-`) to put something into the object:

```{r Ch3NumericObject, echo=TRUE}
number <- 10
```

To see the contents of our object, type its name into the R console.

```{r Ch3NumberSee, echo=TRUE}
number
```

Let's briefly breakdown this output. `10` is clearly the contents of
*number*. The double hash (`##`) is included here to tell you that this
is output rather than R code. If you run functions in your R console,
you will not get the double hash in your output. Finally, `[1]` gives
the position in the object that the number 10 is on. Our object only has
one position.

Creating an object with words and other characters, a character object,
is very similar. The only difference is that you enclose the character
string (letters in a word for example) inside of single or double
quotation marks (`''`, or `""`). Let's create an object called *words*
containing the character string `Hello World`:

```{r Ch3CharacterObject, echo=TRUE}
# Create hello world character string
words <- "Hello World"
```

An object's type is important to keep in mind. It determines what we can
do to the object. For example, you cannot take the mean of a character
object like the *words* object:

```{r Ch3ClassError, echo=TRUE}
mean(words)
```

Trying to find the mean of our *words* object gives us a warning message
and returns the value `r mean(words)`: not applicable. You can also
think of `NA` as meaning "missing". To find out an object's type, use
the `class()` function. For example:

```{r Ch3ClassCommand, echo=TRUE}
class(words)
```

#### Vector and data frame type objects {#vectors-data-frames}

So far, we have only looked at objects with a single number or character
string. Clearly we often want to use objects that have many strings and
numbers. In R these are usually data frame-type objects and are roughly
equivalent to the data structures you would be familiar with from using
a program such as Microsoft Excel. We will be using data frames
extensively throughout the book. Before looking at data frames it is
useful to first look at the simpler objects that make up data frames.
These are called vectors. Vectors are R's "workhorse" [@matloff2011].

##### Vectors

Vectors are the "fundamental data type" in R [@matloff2011]. They are an
ordered group of numbers, character strings, and so on. It may be useful
to think of most data in R as composed of vectors. For example, data
frames are basically collections of vectors of the same length, i.e.
they have the same number of rows, attached together to form columns.

Let's create a simple numeric vector containing the numbers 2.8, 2, and
14.8. To do this, we will use the `c()` (combine) function and separate
the numbers with commas (`,`):

```{r Ch3numeric_vectoror, echo=TRUE}
# Create numeric vector
numeric_vector <- c(2.8, 2, 14.8)

# Show numeric_vector's contents
numeric_vector
```

Vectors of character strings are created in a similar way. The only
difference is that each character string is enclosed in quotation marks
like this:

```{r Ch3CharcterVector, echo=TRUE}

character_vector <- c("Albania", "Botswana", "Cambodia")

# Show character_vector's contents
character_vector
```

##### Matrices

To give you a preview of what we are going to do when we start working
with real data sets, let's combine the two vectors *numeric_vector* and
*character_vector* into a new object with the `cbind()` function. This
function binds the two vectors together side-by-side as columns.

```{r Ch3cbind, echo=TRUE}
string_num_matrix <- cbind(character_vector, numeric_vector)
string_num_matrix
```

By binding these two objects together, we've created a new matrix
object. You can see that the numbers in the **numeric_vector** column
are between quotation marks. Matrices, like vectors, can only have one
data type, so R has converted the numbers to strings.

##### Data frames {#data-frames}

If we want to have an object with rows and columns and allow the columns
to contain data with different types, we need to use data frames. Let's
use the `data.frame` function to combine the *numeric_vector* and
*character_vector* objects.

```{r Ch3dataframe, echo=TRUE, tidy=FALSE}
string_num_df <- data.frame(character_vector, numeric_vector)
string_num_df
```

In this output, you can see the data frame's *names* attribute. It is
the column names. You can use the `names()` function to see any data
frame's names:

```{r Ch10Names, echo=TRUE}
names(string_num_df)
```

You will also notice that the first column of the data set has no name
and is a series of numbers. This is the *row.names* attribute. Data
frame rows can be given any name as long as each row name is unique. We
can use the `row.names()` function to set the row names from a vector.
For example,

```{r Ch3ReassignRowNames, echo=TRUE}
# Reassign row.names
row.names(string_num_df) <- c("First", "Second", "Third")

# Display new row.names
row.names(string_num_df)
```

You can see in this example how `row.names()` can also be used to print
the row names. The *row.names* attribute does not behave like a regular
data frame column. You cannot, for example, include it as a variable in
a regression. You can use the `row.names()` function to assign the
*row.names* values to a regular column.

You will notice in the output for *string_num_df* that the strings in
the **character_vector** column are not in quotation marks. This does
not mean that they are now numeric data. To prove this, try to find the
mean of **character_vector** by running it through the `mean()`
function:

```{r Ch3CharcterVectorMean, echo=TRUE}
mean(string_num_df$character_vector)
```

#### Lists {#lists}

Lists are objects whose contents can be items of different values. For
example you could have a list with a vector and a data frame. Use the
`list()` function to create lists. For example:

```{r create-lists}
vector_df_list <- list(numeric_vector, string_num_df)

vector_df_list
```

Note that each element of the list has a number. For example, the former
contents of *numeric_vector* are element `[[1]]`.

### Component selection {#component-selection}

The last bit of code we just saw will probably be confusing. Why do we
have a dollar sign (`$`) between the name of our data frame object name
and the `character_vector` variable? The dollar sign is called the
component selector.\index{R!component selector}\index{R function!\$}
It's also sometimes called the element name operator. Either way, it
extracts a part, component, of an object. In the previous example, it
extracted the **character_vector** column from the *string_num_df* so
that it could be fed to the `mean()` function.

We can use the component selector to create new objects with parts of
other objects. Imagine that we have *string_num_df* and want an object
with only the information in the **numeric_vector** column. Let's use
the following code:

```{r Ch3CompSelect, echo=TRUE}
# Extract a numeric vector from string_num_df
numeric_extract <- string_num_df$numeric_vector
numeric_extract
```

#### Subscripts {.unnumbered}

Another way to select parts of an object is to use subscripts. You have
already seen subscripts in the output from our examples so far. They are
denoted with square braces (`[]`). We can use subscripts to select not
only columns from data frames but also rows and individual values. As we
began to see in some of the previous output, each part of a data frame
has an address captured by its row and column number. We can tell R to
find a part of an object by putting the row number/name, column
number/name, or both in square braces. The first part denotes the rows
and separated by a comma (`,`) are the columns.

To give you an idea of how this works, let's use the *cars* data set
again. Use `head()` to get a sense of what this data looks like.

```{r Ch3HeadSwiss, echo=TRUE}
head(cars)
```

We can see a data frame with information on various car speeds
(**speed**) and stopping distances (**dist**). If we want to select only
the third through seventh rows, we can use the following subscript
function call:

```{r Ch3FirstSeventhRows, echo=TRUE}
cars[3:7, ]
```

The colon (`:`) creates a sequence of whole numbers from 3 to 7. To
select the fourth row of the **dist** column, we can type:

```{r Ch3FourthSecond, echo=TRUE}
cars[4, 2]
```

An equivalent way to do this is:

```{r Ch3FourthDist, echo=TRUE}
cars[4, "dist"]
```

Finally, we can even include a vector of column names to select:

```{r Ch3FourthBoth, echo=TRUE}
cars[4, c("speed", "dist")]
```

To extract elements of a list use the double square brackets `[[]]`:

```{r double-brackets}
vector_df_list[[2]]
```

You can stack up component selectors to extract deeper components of a
list. For example:

```{r double-brackets-dollar}
vector_df_list[[2]]$numeric_vector
```
