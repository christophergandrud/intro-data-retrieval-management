- What is tidy data?

- Manipulating tidy data (1)

---

# 🙇 Remember: Practical tips for reproducible research

- ✏️ Document Everything!

- 📄 Everything is a (text) file.

- 🤓 All files should be human readable.

- ⋈ Explicitly tie your files together.

- 🗂 Have a plan to organise, store, and make your files available. [And iterate on this plan -- refactor regularly]

# Importance of understanding files/file structures

This topic may seem kind of . . . dry.

Why not just click and drag files with the GUI (Graphical User Interface)?

---

# Importance of understanding files/file structures

1. **Crucial for programmatic access and manipulation**: automated data collection and management _is_ automated file manipulation.

2. **Reproducibility**: other researchers only have your files. If they are **well
    organised** and the **links** between the files are **explicitly stated**
    then they can better understand what you did.

    + Clearest way of explicitly stating links is **dynamically** using file
    paths in your source code.

3. **You**: well organised files will be easier for you to find/understand/use
    in the future.

# 📄 (text) Files

---

# 📄 Why text files?

(Almost) all files are ultimately text files. Note very large data is usually stored in _binary_ file formats

- E.g. a website is typically just a series of connected `.html`, `.js`,
and `.css` files.

- **These are text files!** Despite different file extensions.

    + To see this explore a webpage with
    [Chrome Developer Tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/)

---

# 📄 Why text files?

Text files are **versitile**.

- Store your data (`.csv`, `json`), store your analysis code (`.R`), store your
presentation markup (`.Rmd`).

- They are **simple** and are **not dependent on particular software**.

    - Any text editor can open them.

- Helps **future-proof** research.

- Easy to **version control**.

---

# 📄 CSV Example

CSV (Comma Separated Values)

- All columns are separated by commas--`,`

- All rows are separated by new lines--`\n`

---

# CSV Example

In CSV this:

```
iso2c, country, score
US, United States, 1.086
US, United States, 1.094
US, United States, 1.050
```

Makes:

```{r csvexample, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/CSVBasic.png")
```

# 🗂 Organise your files!

---

# 🌳 File paths & trees

Files are organised **hierarchically** into (upside down) trees.

```
Root
 └── Parent
      ├── Child-1
      └── Child-2
```

---

# 🌳 Root

**Root** directories are the **first level of a disk**.

```
Root
 └── Parent
      ├── Child-1
      └── Child-2
```

They are the root out of which the file tree grows.

**Naming Conventions**:

**Linux/Mac**: `/`

- e.g. `/Parent` means that the `Parent` directory is a child
of the root directory.

**Windows**: the disk is partitioned, e.g. the `C` partition is denoted `C:\`.

- `C:\Parent` indicates that the `Parent` directory is a child
of the `C` partition.

---

# 🚸 Sub (child) directories

Sub (child) directories are denoted with a forward slash `/` in Linux/Mac and a back slash `\` in Windows, e.g.:

```sh
# Linux/Mac
/Parent/Child

# Windows
C:\Parent\Child
```

---

# R tip:

- In R for Windows you either use two backslashes `\\` (`\` is the R [escape
character](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_character))

- Or `/` in **relative paths** in R for Windows, it will know
what you mean.

---

# 🏗 Working directories

A **working directory** is the directory where the program looks for files/other
directories.

⚠️ **Always remember the working directory.** Otherwise you may open/save files that you do not want to open/save.

---

# 🏗 Working directories

**In R:**

```{r}
# Find working directory
getwd()

# List all files in the working directory
list.files()
```

```R
# Set root as working directory
setwd('/')
```

---

# 🤓 in the Terminal Shell

In the **Terminal Shell**:

```sh
# Find working directory
pwd
```

```sh
# Set root as working directory
cd /
```

---

# 🤓 Naming tips

- Data management and analyses files are often kept in a directory called `src` (source). 

- Images are often in an `img` directory.

- If you need to indicate distinct versions, use **version numbers**. Never use "Final" → `FinalFinal-ReallyFinal-Final5` 

- Always, everywhere use the **same date format**: YYYY-MM-DD (e.g. 2020-05-22)

    + [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601)

    + Easy to sort, parse, and use for joins

---

# Relative vs. Absolute file paths

Use **relative file paths** when possible.

- **Absolute file path**: the entire path on a particular system,
    + E.g. `/Parent/Project1/data.csv`

- **Relative file path**: the path relative to the working directory.

    + E.g. if `/Parent` is the working directory then the relative path for
    `data.csv` is `Project1/data.csv`.

Why?

- Crucial for **automation**. Your scripts will run easily on **other computers**. 

- **Enhances reproducibility**.
Easier for your collaborators. Easier for you when you use another computer.

---

# Back up with `../`

You can refer to files in the working directory and further down by stating them, in reference to the working directory. E.g.

```
list.files("child")
```

Will show the files in the *child* directory, which is in the working directory.

You can also back up the tree from the working directory with `../`. For example,

```
list.files("../") 
```

will list the files in the directory above the working directory.

---

# File & directory name conventions

⚠️ **Don't use spaces** in your file names.

They can create problems for programs that treat spaces as an indication that the
path has ended.

Alternatives to spaces:

- `kebab-case` (e.g. `data-analysis.R`)

- `CamelCase` (ex. `DataAnalysis.R`)

- `file_underscore` (ex. `data_analysis.R`)

---

# Load files into R--Dynamically Link

There are a number of R commands to load files, depending on the file type.

- Load Data: `read.table`, `read.csv` `read.dta` `xlsx::read.xlsx`,
`rio::import`, `jsonlite::read_json`, `readr::read_csv`

```{r, eval=FALSE}
read.csv('data/test-data.csv')
```

- Save Data: e.g. `write.csv()`, `write.dta()`, `jsonlite::write_json()`

- Databases: [dbplyr](https://db.rstudio.com/dplyr/)

- Load and run R source code: `source()`

---

# R Input/Output of well structured data from URLs

🧨🎇😵URLs are also **file paths for files on the internet**.

You can use them the same way as local file paths.

The [rio](https://github.com/leeper/rio) package can import many different
file types (including from URLS) with the same function: `import()`.

```{r}
library(rio)
disprop <- import('http://bit.ly/Ss6zDO', format = 'csv')
head(disprop)
```

---

# Advanced: Git and GitHub for source code management

Not covered in this course, but you should always manage your source code with a tool like Git/GitHub. 

See [here](https://cdn.rawgit.com/HertieDataScience/SyllabusAndLectures/8392513e7e826f5d7842bd437d9a415b808ef745/LectureSlides/Lecture3/Lecture3.html#26) for more details.

Let me know if you are interested and I can give you an introduction if we have time.

# 🧹 Tidy Structured Data

---

# Rows and columns have no meaning!

Many (not all) statistical data sets are organised into **rows** and **columns**.

Rows and columns have **no inherent meaning**.

Wickham (2014) laid out **principles of data
tidying** to standardize statistical semantics.

- Links the **physical structure** of a data set to its **meaning**
(semantics).

---

# Two ways to represent the same data

| Person       |  treatmentA | treatmentB |
| ------------ | ----------- | ---------- |
| John Smith   |             | 2          |
| Jane Doe     | 16          | 11         |
| Mary Johnson | 3           | 1          |

<br>

| Treatment  | John Smith | Jane Doe | Mary Johnson |
| ---------- | ---------- | -------- | ------------ |
| treatmentA |            | 16       | 3            |
| treatmentB | 2          | 11       | 1            |


---

# Data sets are **collections of values**.

All values are assigned to a **variable** and an **observation**.

- **Variable**: all values measuring the same attribute across units

- **Observation**: all values measured within the same unit across attributes.

---

# Tidy data semantics + structure

<br>

1. Each variable forms a column.

2. Each observation forms a row.

3. Each type of observational unit forms a table.

# Tidy data

| Person       |  treatment  | result     |
| ------------ | ----------- | ---------- |
| John Smith   | a           |            |
| Jane Doe     | a           | 16         |
| Mary Johnson | a           | 3          |
| John Smith   | b           | 2          |
| Jane Doe     | b           | 11         |
| Mary Johnson | b           | 1          |

# 🧹 Messy to Tidy data

First identify what your observations and variables are.

Then use R tools to convert your data into this format.

**tidyr** is particularly useful.

---

# Messy to tidy data

```{r}
# Create messy (wide) data
messy <- data.frame(
  person = c("John Smith", "Jane Doe", "Mary Johnson"),
  a = c(NA, 16, 3),
  b = c(2, 11, 1)
)

messy
```

---

# Messy to tidy data

Using `pivot_longer()`

```{r pivotlonger}
tidied <- tidyr::pivot_longer(data = messy, 
                     cols = c("a", "b"),     # Columns to pivot
                     names_to = "treatment",
                     values_to = "result")
tidied
```

---

# Tidy to messy data

Sometimes it is useful to reverse this operation with `pivot_wider`.

```{r}
messy_again <- tidyr::pivot_wider(data = tidied, 
                                 names_from = "treatment",
                                 values_from = result)

messy_again
```

---

# 🧹 Data cleaning tips

Always **look at** and **poke your data**.

For example, see if:

- Missing values are designated with `NA`

- Variable types are what you expect them to be.

- Distributions are what you expect them to be.

# 🥅 With a partner

Find a CSV formatted data set online and programmatically load it into R.

If it is in long format, pivot wider. 

If it is in wide format, pivot longer.
