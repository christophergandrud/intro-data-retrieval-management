## ðŸ‘© ðŸ’» Building

The materials are built using blogdown and RStudio's tools for managing blogdown content.

There are two important directories for **making changes** to the content:

- `content/post` is where the non-slide content for editing is stored.

- `static/slides` is where the slides source files for editing are stored.

**Do not edit the files in `public`**. These are generated automatically by blogdown.
